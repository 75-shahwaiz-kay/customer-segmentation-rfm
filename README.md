## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** combined with **KMeans Clustering** to segment customers into distinct groups.  
The goal is to help businesses identify **loyal customers, big spenders, and inactive customers**, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. RFM Feature Engineering
3. Applying **KMeans Clustering**
4. Interpreting Clusters (Whales, Average Customers, Lapsed Customers)
5. Visualizing Results with charts

## 📊 Customer Segments
- **Whales** 🐳 – High spenders, most valuable customers  
- **Avg.CX** 🙂 – Regular, average customers  
- **Lapsed.CX** ⏳ – Inactive or low-value customers
